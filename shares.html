										<p>Shares are a part of a company's capital. By purchasing a share you become a member, with your shares you are entitled to attend company meetings and you are entitled to a dividend if the company produces profits.
										<br>For listed companies the value is established by the market, especially from the company's prospects for general profits over time.

										<h4>An example of a share trend</h4>The chart shows the price trend of one share of the Italian market: in January 2016, the share was worth 8€. In February the price decreased to a value of 6€, see then that significant decrease occurred in June 2016
 is due to the referendum on Brexit that was expected to negatively affect the performance of the economy and the profits of companies

								<p>The value of an investment in share is first measured by its rate of return, in the case of shares the return is composed of two elements: 
									<br>-Dividends
									<br>-Capital gain (the difference between the selling price and the purchase price).</p>
								<p><font color="#F56A6A">For example:</font>
									<br>If today you buy the stock at the price “P”  and in a year you receive the dividend “D” and sell the stock at the price “Q”, your gain will be given by:
									<br><b>RATE OF RETURN  = D + Q - P </b>
									<br>If you then divide the value thus obtained by the purchase price of the share and then multiply it by 100, you will get the rate of return expressed in percentages.</p>
								<p>All this can be calculated by yourself or provided by a financial intermediary in the statement on your portfolio that is the sum of your investments.</p>

									</header>
								<p>Investing in stocks can lead to big gains but also big losses if the market price varies. For example:
the failure of the company leads to a zero price and the loss of savings invested. You don’t have a safety net if things go wrong. Simply put, actions are risky because their course over time is uncertain.
 
								<br>To understand if you are gaining or losing with your investment, just look at the rate of return. </p>
									<p> <font color="#F56A6A">For example</font>
									<br>Suppose you buy a share at 70€ and in a year you receive a dividend of 2€, if you sell the stock at 78€ your rate of return will be 14% [(2+78-70)/70*100]; but if you are unlucky and you sell the share
 at a time when its price is reduced, for example, by €61, then the rate of return will be -10%. [(2+61-70)/70*100].</p>
								<p>As you can see, the return will depend very much on the selling price and may also be negative, in which case you will suffer a loss.</p>
